          <p>I guess the writing on this page should be an improvment to the writing in the previous assignment. The assignment didn't 
          specify that we had to have a more interesting "about" page in this portfolio but it seems reasonable to assume so. The steps
          that we take to make a website both are and are not completely clear.</p>
          <br />
          <p>In the same way that files stuctures require us to move down the list or sideways through it, a paragraph structure forces the
          writer and later, the reader to enter first one subject and then the one placed within it, in the next paragraph. Who really deserves to decide
          what is, and what is not, a paragraph? Frequently it is determined by the topic covered, word count, or number of sentences. I think that it's time 
          our paragraphs more seriously. They are determined with some kind of logic, but occasionally there will be very long paragraphs as well as very
          short paragraphs in a single peice and it can cause confusion if the text is not broken up properly.
